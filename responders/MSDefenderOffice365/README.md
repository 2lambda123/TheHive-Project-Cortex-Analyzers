The Tenant Allow/Block List in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal gives you a way to manually override the Microsoft 365 filtering verdicts. The Tenant Allow/Block List is used during mail flow for incoming messages (does not apply to intra-org messages) and at the time of user clicks.

This responder is intended to support blocking or unblocking sender email addresses or domains from an observable.

An observable with dataType 'mail' is used to block/unblock a sender, while dataType 'domain' is used to block/unblock a domain.
